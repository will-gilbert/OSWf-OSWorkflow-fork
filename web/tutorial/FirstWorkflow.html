        <h2>Simple Worklow - Requesting a Holiday</h2>
        <p>Let's define a simple workflow where we are requesting a day off ('holiday' for 
            our international readers). 
            OSWf <b>Process Definitions</b> (workflows) are specified in an XML file, one per file.</p>
        <p>Let's start by creating the file called '<code>holiday.oswf.xml</code>'. The minimum content for 
          this file will contain the DTD definition, a set of one or more <code>initial-actions</code> which
          serve as entry points into the workflow and set of <code>steps</code> and <code>actions</code> which a process instance will occupy
          as the workflow is processed. Steps are also known as nodes and states, while actions may be
          referred to as transitions in other workflow implementations.</p>
      </div>

      <pre class='code'>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE workflow PUBLIC "-//Open Source Workflow//DTD OSWf 3.0//EN" 
          "http://oswf.sourceforge.net/OSWf-3.0.dtd"&gt;


&lt;workflow&gt;

  &lt;initial-actions&gt;
        .
        .
        .
  &lt;/initial-actions&gt;


  &lt;steps&gt;
     .
     .
     .
  &lt;/steps&gt;

&lt;/workflow&gt;

</pre>
 
<p>Note that OSWf will validate the XML file to the specified DTD, thus the workflow definition
<b>has to be valid</b>. You can create and edit workflows using any XML tools and errors will
be highlighted appropriately. The DTD is contained within the <code>oswf-core</code> JAR file
and can be extracted for use with XML editing and validation tools. It can also be downloaded
from <code><a =href'http://oswf.sourceforge.net/OSWf-3.0.dtd'>http://oswf.sourceforge.net/OSWf-3.0.dtd</a></code>
</p>

<h3>Steps and Actions</h3>

<p>Next we specify the <code>initial-actions</code>, <code>steps</code> and <code>actions</code>. The first 
important concept to understand the difference between initial-actions, steps and actions in a workflow. 
A step is simply a place or position.  As a workflow progresses, a process instance moves from one step to another by 
way of actions.  A step may be occupied for a very short period of time or very long period of 
time.  A step has the start time when it was entered and a entry status.  When acted upon by an action, 
a step will have a finished time and an exit status, optionally, a completed step will have an 'actor' 
which caused the action to be fired.  Actors can be thought of as users, timers or external system
events. Steps can also have <code>auto</code> actions which occur immediately and have no actor.
</p>

<p>In OSWf, initial-actions, steps and actions have a unique numbers and a name. Name need not be
unique but are helpful if they are.  The name can be used by
the application and in reporting, the number is used by the workflow engine.  More on this
later.</p>

<p>
Actions specify the transitions that can take place within a particular step based on
condtions. An action can result in a transition to another step or change the state of the
current step, that is, actions can loop back onto their step of origin. 
Examples of actions in our Holiday Request example will be '<code>Start
Workflow</code>', '<code>Request holiday</code>', '<code>Approve</code>', and
'<code>Deny</code>'. Verbs are commonly used as action names but not required, however, it does
make the workflow easier to read.  Every step except terminal step have at least one action
which specifies a <code>default-result</code>.
</p>

<p>Put simply, a step is 'where a process instance is', and an action is 'how the process
instance can change'.</p>

<p><code>Initial actions</code> are a special type of action that are used to 'kick off' a workflow. When
a workflow is created, it has no state, and it is not in any step. The application must provide
some mechanism to start off the process by choosing from the set of possible initial actions to start the
workflow is specified in <code>&lt;initial-actions&gt;</code>. That said, most workflows have a single
action, named 'Start Workflow' or simply 'Start'. </p>

<p>For our Holiday workflow, let us assume that we only have one initial-action, 'Start Workflow'. 
Add the following action definition inside of <code>&lt;initial-actions&gt;</code>:</p>

<pre class="code">
  &lt;initial-actions>
  
    &lt;action id='1' name='Start Workflow'>
      &lt;results>
        &lt;default-result step='100'/>
      &lt;/results>
   &lt;/action>
   
  &lt;/initial-actions>
</pre>

<p>This inital-action is the simplest possible type of action. It specifies a single (default) 
result which moves to a new step.</p>


<p>
A brief note about <b>id</b> numbers. The <b>id</b> numbers for initial-actions, actions and steps
must be unique within each of XML tag types.  This will also apply to other OSWf tags such as splits and
joins which we will encounter soon.  As a personal convention, I use single digits (1..9) for
initial actions, splits and joins as there tend to be few of these in most workflows; for steps I
start with 100 and work up in increments of 100, 50 or 10 (100, 200, 300...) leaving room for intermediate
steps as the workflow develops. Within each step, action ids start with the step number and
increase by one or two (100 101, 102...). Most steps have only one action to move the workflow
forward hence this convention works well.  This is only a convention but it helps me to organize
the workflow description and allows me to insert steps and actions in the future. In the event
of large workflow steps can be numbered by 50's or 10's.  Ids need not be assigned in any
order. Order is only useful for display or reports.  You get the idea. 
</p>


<h3>The First Step: Requesting a Holiday</a></h3>

<p>
The first step of our simple workflow is for an employee to enter a request for a holiday. This might
involve a web page with a form, or a verbal or written request. It is important to note that a
workflow system merely tracks the steps and processes the actions of a real world process and DOES
NOT IMPLEMENT THE PROCESS. It is the responsibility of the application, human or computer to inform
the workflow system of the actions chosen. The workflow system responds and can then be queried
by an application process in order to determine what actions are available to the application.
</p>

<pre class='code'>
  &lt;step id='100' name='Employee request'>
    &lt;actions>
      &lt;action id='100' name='Request holiday'>
        &lt;results>
          &lt;default-result exit-status='Requested' step='200'/>
        &lt;/results>
     &lt;/action>
   &lt;/actions>
  &lt;/step>
</pre>


<h3>Step Status</h3>

<p>
The <code>default-result</code> for this step has an additional attribute called <code>exit-status</code>.
This is an optional attribute used to indicate the final status of a step, the OSWf default exit-status
is 'Finished'.  Here it's a bit useless as we can only exit this step by one action but I wanted
to introduce this option before the next section.
</p>

<p><b>NB</b>: An 'exit-status' attribute is not used by the <b>initial-actions</b>'s <b>action</b> tags.</p>

<!--
A step status is a string that describes the status of a particular step. In our holiday
request workflow, step 100 will take on the status of 'Underway'. Had we not specified a
'status' the step status would take on the value of 'Pending', which in most cases is
sufficient, but I wanted to show you how a step's status is specified.
</p>

<p>Wait a second! You're probably wondering, as I did when I first started using OSWorkflow as 
to why a step's status is not set by itself.  This allow the action which which causes the step
to 'come into being' to state how or why the step was created. Make sense? It will in more
complex worflows.</p>
-->

<!--
<p>
In workflow language the employee is 'Actor' who initiates a workflow process, by completing
the required form or paperwork in an application process causes the workflow to proceed to 
step 200. Here we did not specify a 'status' or 'exit-status', which default to 'Pending' and 
'Finished', respectively.
</p>
-->


<h3>The Next Step: It's the Managers Turn</a></h3>

<p>
The workflow has now progressed to step 200, 'Manager Approval'.  This is where the manager
must decide to allow or deny the employee's holiday based on workload, if other employees are available for
coverage, this employee's available balance of holiday time, etc.  In workflow language, "<i>a
work task has been added to the manager's <b>Work List</b></i>".  He or she must use a
web form, application or human to record a decision.  Let's look at the available
choices as defined in the workflow:
</p>

<pre class='code'>
  &lt;step id='200' name='Manager Approval'>
    &lt;actions>

      &lt;!-- Manager approves holiday ====== -->
      &lt;action id='201' name='Approve' finish='true'>
        &lt;results>
          &lt;default-result exit-status='Revised' />
        &lt;/results>
      &lt;/action>

      &lt;!-- Manager denies holiday ======== -->
      &lt;action id='202' name='Deny' finish='true'>
        &lt;results>
          &lt;default-result exit-status='Revised' />
        &lt;/results>
     &lt;/action>  &lt;/actions>
  &lt;/step>
</pre>

<p>
This step has two actions named 'Approve' or 'Deny',
with ids of 201 and 202.  The exit-status for the step in either case will be 'Revised'. But 
we could have used the OSWf default of 'Finished'. We could have used 'Approve' or 'Deny' and 
probably should have but I'd like to show you a better way to record the manager's decision
in the next few paragraphs.
</p>

<p> 
All done!
</p>

<p>
Not so fast! How can 
the employee know of the manager's decision?  We need some kind of persistent
store, like a database or at very least another step which sends an e-mail to the employee,
human resources and payroll departments.
</p>

<p>
OSWf can save the manager's decision as a name/value pair to a <code>PropertySet</code> which is
an really neat Java framework also from OpenSymphony and also abandoned like OSWorkflow.  Let's add
a post-function to each action, shown in red in our revised workflow steps. You can read about
'post-function' in another tutorial but for now the name should be pretty self-explanatory:
<i>Execute this function after this action has been chosen</i>. For now don't worry about the syntax,
all will be revealed in time.
</p>


<pre class='code'>
  &lt;step id='200' name='Manager Approval'>
    &lt;actions>

      &lt;!-- Manager approves holiday ====== -->
      &lt;action id='201' name='Approve' finish='true'>
        &lt;results>
          &lt;default-result exit-status='Revised' />
        &lt;/results>
        <span style='color:red;'>&lt;post-functions>
          &lt;function type='beanshell'>
            &lt;arg name='script'>propertySet.setString('result', 'approved');&lt;/arg>
          &lt;/function>
        &lt;/post-functions></span>
      &lt;/action>

      &lt;!-- Manager denies holiday ======== -->
      &lt;action id='202' name='Deny' finish='true'>
        &lt;results>
          &lt;default-result exit-status='Revised' />
        &lt;/results>
        <span style='color:red;'>&lt;post-functions>
          &lt;function type='beanshell'>
            &lt;arg name='script'>propertySet.setString('result', 'denied');&lt;/arg>
          &lt;/function>
        &lt;/post-functions></span>
     &lt;/action>  &lt;/actions>
  &lt;/step>
</pre>

<p>
There are also ways from within OSWf to save the result of a step or action however you want
or wherever you want. You would to write an OSWf function to do this.  The <b>PropertySet</b> name/value
pair storage is builtin and work nicely for use within OSWf.
</p>

<p>
Now we can look up the final decision in a database or add a step to send an e-mail to the 
employee and notify the human resouces and payroll departments.  One more thing, 
notice in each action the
attribute <code>finish='true'</code>.  Although, the workflow has no more steps, these actions
will put this process instance into a <b>Completed</b> state.
