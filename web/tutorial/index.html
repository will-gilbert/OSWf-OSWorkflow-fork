        <h2>OSWf Concepts</h2>

        <p>
        OSWf is fairly different from most other workflow systems available, both
        commercially and in the open source world. What makes OSWf different is that it
        is application devloper oriented and hence extermely flexible. However, this can be hard to grasp at first. 
        </p>
        <p>
        For example,
        OSWf does not have a graphical tool for developing workflows, and the
        recommended approach is to write the XML workflow descriptors 'by hand' with your favorite text or XML editor. 
        </p>
        <p>
        It is up to
        the application developer to provide this sort of integration, as well as any
        integration with existing code and databases. These may seem like problems to someone
        who is looking for a quick "plug-and-play" workflow solution, but we've found that such
        a solution never provides enough flexibility to properly fulfill all requirements in a
        full-blown application.
        </p>
        
        <p align='center'>
        <span style='font-size:larger; font-weight:bold;'>OSWf gives the developer flexibility
        <p>
        
        <p>
        OSWf can be considered a "low level" workflow
        implementation. Situations like "loops" and "conditions" that might be represented by a
        graphical icon in other workflow systems are "coded" in OSWf. That's not to
        say that actual code is needed to implement situations like this, but a scripting
        language must be employed to specify these conditions. 
        </p>
        <p>
        It is not expected that a
        non-technical user modify workflow. We've found that although some systems provide GUIs
        that allow for simple editing of workflows, the applications surrounding the workflow
        usually end up damaged when changes like these are made. We believe it is best for
        these changes to be made by a developer who is aware of each change.
    	</p>


        
        <p>
        OSWf is based heavily on the concept of the <strong><em>finite state
        machine</em></strong>.  Each state in represented by the combination of a step ID and a status. A
        <b>transition</b> from one state to another cannot happen without an action occuring. 
        There are always at least one or more active states during the lifetime of a
        workflow. These simple concepts are what lie at the core of the OSWf process engine and
        allow a simple XML file to be translated in to business workflow
        processes.
        </p>

        <h3>Workflow Descriptor</h3>
        
        <p>
        At the heart of OSWf is the workflow definition descriptor, also know as the process
        descriptor. The descriptor is an XML file.
	    </p>
	
	    <p>
	    This descriptor describes all the steps, states, transitions, and functionality for a
	    given workflow.
		</p>
		
		<ul>
		
		    <li class='point'>
		    	A <strong>Process Instance</strong> is an individual or entity moving through a
		    	workflow. A workflow may have many process instances, a process
		    	instance can be associated with a single workflow. Note that a
		    	workflow split will cause the process instance to appear as if
		    	it is in multiple place i.e. states at once.  This is valid.
		    </li>
		
		    <li class='point'>
		    	A workflow can have one or more starting points i.e. <strong>intial actions</strong>.
		    </li>

		    <li class='point'>
		    	A workflow consists of multiple <strong>steps</strong> to represent the flow. A step
		    	represents a state in the workflow.
		    </li>
		
		    <li class='point'>
		    	For each step, there may be multiple <strong>actions</strong>. An action may be set 
		    	to run automatically or be invoked programmatically 
		    	through user or external interaction.
			</li>

			<li class='point'>
				Each action has at least one <strong>default result</strong> and zero or more <strong>conditional results</strong>, which determine the next step. An action can be 
				thought of as being instantaneous e.g. it does represent a state.
			</li>

			<li class='point'>
				If multiple conditional results
				are specified, the first result for which all conditions are met is
				executed. If no conditional results are specified, or if no conditions are
				satisfied, then the default result is executed.
			</li>
				   
			<li class='point'>
				A <strong>result</strong> might loop back into the
				current step, reference a new step, reference a split, or reference a join.
				In all cases, the state of the workflow can also change (example workflow
				states are Underway, Queued, and Finished).
			</li>
				    
			<li class='point'>
				A <strong>split</strong> may have one or more unconditional results,
				but no conditional results. The unconditional results reference the steps
				coming from the split.
			</li>
				    

			<li class='point'>
				A <strong>register</strong> is a global variable, that is resolved
				for every workflow invocation and is always available to all functions and
				conditions.
			</li>

				    
			<li class='point'>
				<strong>Process variables</strong> are stored as a map of persistent data that is available
				globally for reading or writing.
			</li>

				    
			<li class='point'>
				A map called 'transientVars' is a map of <strong>transient data</strong> that 
				is available to all functions and conditions that includes all registers, 
				user inputs, as well as the current workflow context and state. It 
				exists only during the lifetime of a workflow invocation.
			</li>

		</ul


				    
		<p>
		OSWf is very unique compared to other workflow engines one might be familiar
		with. In order to completely grasp OSWf and properly harness the features
		available, it is important that one understand the core concepts that form the
		foundation for OSWf.
		</p>
				    
		<h3>Steps, Status &amp; Actions</h3>
				    
		<p>
			Any particular <em>process instance</em> can have one or more <em>current steps</em>
			at any given moment. Every current step has a <em>status</em> associated to it.
			The statuses of all of the current steps constitute <em>workflow status</em> for that
			process instance. <b>The actual statuses are entirely up to the application
			developer and/or project manager</b>. A status is string and can be, for example, "Underway"
			"Ready" or "Pending".
		</p>

        <p>
        	For the workflow to progress, a <em>transition</em> must take place
			in the finite state machine that represents a workflow instance. Once a step is
			completed it can not be current. Usually a new current step is created
			immediately thereafter, which keeps the workflow going. The final status of the
			completed step is set by the <b>exit-status</b> attribute. It happens just before the
			transition to another step. <em>exit-status</em> must already be defined when a new
			transition takes place in the workflow. <em>It can be any value you please, but
			"Finished" or "Completed" usually works for most applications</em>.
		</p>

        <p>
        	<em>Transition</em>
			itself is a result of an <em>action</em>. A step may have many actions connected to it.
			Which particular action will be launched is determined by the end user, external event
			or automatically by a trigger. Depending on the action accomplished, a certain
			transition takes place. Actions can be restricted to particular groups and users or
			current state of the workflow. Each action must have one <em>unconditional result</em>
			(default) and zero or more <em>conditional results</em>.
		</p>

        <p>
        	So, to summarize, a workflow consists of a number of Steps. A step has a current status (for example, Queued, Underway, or Finished). A step has a number of Actions that can be performed in
			it. An action has Conditions under which it is available, as well as Functions that are
			executed. Actions have results that change the state and current step of the workflow.
		</p>


				    
				    
		<h3>Results, Joins &amp; Splits<h3>
			
		<h4>Default Result</h4>

		<p>
			For every action, it is required that there exist at least one result, called the
			<code>default-result</code>. A result is nothing more than a series of conditions which determine
			the next step to move to. This involves making a transition from one
			step to the next step(s) in the state machine that makes up a given workflow. 
		</p>

		<p>
			In OSWf the tag <code>default-result</code> replaced the tag <code>unconditional-result
			</code> from OSWf.
		</p>

				    
		<h4>Conditional Results</h4>

		<p>
			A <code>conditional-result</code> is similiar to <code>default-result</code>
			except that it requires one or more additional <code>conditions</code>. The first <code>conditional-result</code> that evaluates to true (using the types
			<b>AND</b> or <b>OR</b>) will dictate which transition to execute. Additional information regarding conditions can be found below.
		</p>
				    
		<p>
			There are three different results (conditional or default) that can occur:
		</p>
				    
		<ul>
		    <li>A transition to a single step</li>
		    <li>A transition to a <code>split</code> which creates two or more steps</li>
		    <li>A <code>join</code> that combines together this transition and other transitions
		     to a single step</li>
		</ul>
	
		<p>
			<em>One caveat regarding transitions</em>, currently a split or a join cannot result in an
			immediate split or join again. However, this is not a major issue, simply insert a step
			with a single automatic action default action between the join and the next split.
		</p>		  
				    
		<p>
			A single step result can be specified simply by taking all of the default attributes,
			for example:
		</p>

		
		<pre class="code">  &lt;default-result step='2' /></pre>

		<p>Alternatively, the optional attributes can be specified as in this exampe:</p>
		
		<pre class="code">  &lt;default-result exit-status='Finished' status='Pending' step='2' owner='${actor}' /></pre>
		
		<p>
			In certain cases the result of an action does not require a transition to another step.
			Such a result may be specified by setting the step value to -1.  For example, we can
			change the above example to remain in the current step (or steps) as follows:
		</p>

		<pre class="code">  &lt;default-result status='Repeat' step='-1' /></pre>

		<p>
			Splitting from one step to multiple steps can be achieved as shown below.
		</p>

		
		
		<pre class="code">
    &lt;default-result split='1'/>
            .
            .
            .
    &lt;splits>
    
      &lt;split id='1'>;
        &lt;default-result step='200'  owner='${someActor}' />
        &lt;default-result step='300'  owner='${someOtherActor}' />
      &lt;/split>
      
    &lt;/splits></pre>

    	<p>
    		Joins are the most complex but interesting cases. A typical join might look like:
    	</p>

    
    	<pre class="code">
  &lt;splits>
    
    &lt;split id='1'>;
      &lt;default-result exit-status='Finished' join='1' />
            .
            .
            .
      &lt;default-result exit-status='Finished' join='1' />
    &lt;/split>
      
  &lt;/splits>
            .
            .
            .
  &lt;joins>

    &lt;join id="1">
      &lt;conditions type="AND">
        &lt;condition type="beanshell">
          &lt;arg name="script">
            "Finished".equals(jn.getStep(200).getStatus())  &amp;&amp;
            "Finished".equals(jn.getStep(300).getStatus())
          &lt;/arg>
        &lt;/condition>
      &lt;/conditions>
      &lt;default-result step="400" />
    &lt;/join>
  
  &lt;/joins></pre>


    	<p>
		    The above might seem somewhat cryptic, but the main thing to notice is that the
		    <b>condition XML element</b> uses a special variable <b>"jn"</b> that can be used to make up
		    expressions that determine when the join actually occurs. Essentially, this expression
		    statement says <b>"proceed to step 400 only when the steps with IDs 200 and 300 have
		    transitioned into this join have a status of 'Finished'".</b> 
    	</p>


	    <p>
		    Being able to write code in order to determine how a join should proceed is on the greatest
		    strenghts of OSWf. Besides using the <b>jn</b> variable to look at the status
		    of incoming steps one can also use the name/value pairs stored in the PropertSet to create
		    very flexible join logic.
	    </p>
    
    <h3>Functions</h3>

    <p>
    OSWf defines a standard way for external business logic and services to be defined
    and executed. This is accomplished by using "functions". A function usually encapsulates
    functionality that is external to the workflow instance itself, perhaps related to updating
    an external entity or system with workflow information, or notifying an external system
    regarding a change in workflow status.
    </p>

    <p><em>There are two types of functions: <strong>pre</strong> and 
    <strong>post</strong> step functions.</em> 
    </p>
    
    <p><strong>Pre</strong> functions are functions that are executed <strong>before</strong>
    the workflow makes a particular transition. An example is a pre function that sets up the
    name of the caller to use as the result for the state change that is about to take place.
    Another example of a pre-function is a function that updates the most recent caller of an
    action. Both of these are provided as standard utility functions that are very useful for
    practical workflows. 
    </p>


    
    <p><strong>Post</strong> functions have the same range of applicability as pre
    functions, except that they are executed <strong>after</strong> the state change 
    has taken place. An example of a post function is one that sends out an email to 
    interested parties that the workflow has had a particular action performed on it. 
    For example, when a document in the 'research' step has a 'markReadyForReview' action 
    taken, the reviewers group is emailed.
    </p>

    <p>There are many reasons for including pre and post functions. One is that if the
    user were to click the "done" button twice and to send out two "execute action" calls, and
    that action had a pre function that took a long time to finish, then it is possible the
    long function could get called multiple times, because the transition hasn't been made yet,
    and OSWf thinks the second call to perform the action is valid. So changing that
    function to be a post function is what has to happen. <em>Generally pre functions are for
    simple, quick executions, and post functions are where the "meat" goes.</em>
    </p>

    <p>Functions can be specified in two separate locations; steps and actions.</p>
    
    <p>Usually, a pre or post
    function is specified in an action. The general case is that along with transitioning the
    workflow, a functions is used to 'do something', whether it be notifying a third party,
    sending an email, or simply setting variables for future use. The following diagram will
    help illustrate action level functions:</p>

    
    <div align='center'>
        <img src="images/actionfunctions.png" />
    </div>
    
    <p>
    In the case of pre and post functions being specified on steps, the usage is slightly
    different. Pre-functions specified on a step will be executed <em>before</em> the workflow
    is transitioned to that step. Note that these functions will be applied indiscriminantly to
    ALL transitions to the step, even those that originate in the step itself (for example,
    moving from Queued to Underway within the same step will cause the invocation of any step
    pre-functions specified).
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Similarly, step post-functions will be called prior to the workflow transitioning
    <em>out</em> of the step, even if it's to change state and remain within the step.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    The following diagram illustrates the invocation order. Note that the action box is
    abbreviated and could well contain pre and post functions of its own.

<!--    
    <h3>Trigger Functions</h3>
    <p>
    Trigger functions are just like any other function, except that they aren't associated
    with only one action. They are also identified with a unique ID that is used at a later
    time (when a trigger is fired) to be executed by the Quartz job scheduler (or any other job
    scheduler). These functions usually run under the context of a system user and not a
    regular user working in the workflow. Trigger functions are invoked by using the OSWf
    API from an outside source, such as a job scheduler like Quartz.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    You can find more information on <a href="TriggerFunctions.html" title="Trigger functions">Trigger
    functions</a>.
    </p>
 -->

    <h3>Validators</h3>
    <p>
    A validator is nothing more than some code that validates the input that can be paired
    with an action. If the input is deemed to be valid, according to the validator, the action
    will be executed. If the input is invalid, the <em>InvalidInputException</em> will be
    thrown back to the calling client - usually a JSP or servlet.
    </p>

    <p>
    Validators follow many of the same rules as Functions. You can find out more about <a
    href="Validators.html" title="Validators">Validators</a>.
    </p>

    <h3>Registers</h3>
    <p>
    A register is a helper function that returns an object that can be used in Functions for
    easy access to common objects, especially entities that revolve around the workflow. The
    object being registered can be any kind of object. Typical examples of objects being
    registered are: Document, Metadata, Issue, and Task. This is strictly for convenience and
    does not add any extra benefit to OSWf besides making the developer's life much
    simpler. Here is an example of a register:
    </p>

    
    <pre class="code">
  &lt;registers>
    &lt;register name="doc" class="com.acme.DocumentRegister"/>
  &lt;/registers>
       .
       .
       .
    &lt;results>
      &lt;result condition="doc.priority == 1" step="1" status="Underway"  owner="${someManager}"/>
      &lt;unconditional-result step="1" status="Queued"/>
    &lt;/results></pre>




    <h3>Conditions</h3>

    <p>
    Conditions, just like validators, registers, and functions, can be implemented in a variety
    of languages and technologies. Conditions can be grouped together using <b>AND</b> or
    <b>OR</b> logic. Any other kind of complex login must be implemented by the workflow
    developer. Conditions usually associated with conditional results, where a result is
    executed based on the conditions imposed on it being satisfied.</p>

    <p>Conditions are very
    similar to functions except that they return <b>boolean</b> instead of <b>void</b>. You can
    find out more about <a href="Conditions.html" title="Conditions">Conditions</a>.</p>




    <h3>Variable Interpolation</h3>

    <p>
    In all functions, conditions, validators, and registers it is possible to provide a set of
    <b>args</b> to the code of choice. These args are translated to the <b>args Map</b> that is
    discussed in further detail later on. Likewise the <b>status, old-status, and owner
    elements</b> in the workflow descriptor are also all parsed for variables to be dynamically
    converted. A variable is identified when it looks like <b>${foo}</b>. OSWf recognizes
    this form and first looks in the <b>transientVars</b> for the key foo. If the key does not
    exist as a transient variable, then then  <b>propertySet</b> is searched. If the
    propertyset does not contain the specified key either, then the entire variable is
    converted to an empty String.</p>

    <p>One thing of particular importance is that in the
    case of <b>args</b>, if the variable is the only argument, the argument will not be of type
    String, but instead whatever the variable type is. However, if the arg is a mix of
    characters and variables, the entire argument is converted to String no matter what. That
    means the two arguments below are very different in that foo is a Date object and bar is a
    String:</p>
    
    <pre class="code">
    &lt;arg name="foo">${someDate}&lt;/arg>
    &lt;arg name="bar"> ${someDate} &lt;/arg> &lt;!-- note the extra spaces --></pre>



    <h3>Permissions and Restrictions</h3>

    <p>
    <em>Permissions</em> can be assigned to users and/or groups based on the state of the
    workflow instance. These permissions are unrelated to the functionality of the workflow
    engine, but they are useful to have for applications that implement OSWf. For
    example, a document management system might have the permission name
    "file-write-permission" enabled for a particular group only during the "Document Edit"
    stage of the workflow. That way your application can use the API to determine if files can
    be modified or not. This is useful as there could be a number of states within the workflow
    where the "file-write-permission" is applicable, so instead of checking for specific steps
    or conditions, the check can simply be made for a particular
    permission.</p>

    <p>
    Permissions and actions both use the concept of <em>restrictions</em>.
    <b>A restriction is nothing more than one or more conditions embedded inside a restrict-to
    element.</b>
    </p>


    <h3>Auto Actions</h3>
    <p>Sometimes it is desirable to have an action performed automatically, based on specific
    conditions. This is useful for example when trying to add automation to a workflow. In
    order to achieve this, an attribute of <b>auto="true"</b> will have to be added to the
    specific action. The workflow engine will then evaluate the conditions and restrictions on
    the action, and if they are matched and the workflow <b>could</b> perform the action, then
    it automatically does so. The auto action executes with the current caller, so the
    permissions checks and so on are performed against the user who called the action that
    initiated the auto action.</p>


    <h3>PropertySet - Name/Value Pairs</h3>


    <p>
    At any point in the workflow, you will likely want to persist small pieces of data. This is
    made possible in OSWf by the use of the OpenSymphony PropertySet library. A
    PropertySet is basically a persistent, type-safe Map. You can add items to the propertyset
    (one is created per workflow) and later on retrieve them. The propertyset is not emptied or
    deleted unless you explicitly do so yourself. Every function and condition has access to
    this propertyset, as well as any inline scripts, where it is added to the script context
    with the name 'propertySet'. So, to illustrate an inline script accessing the property set,
    let's add the following to our 'Start First Draft' actions' pre-functions.
    </p>

    
    <pre class="code">
  &lt;function type="beanshell">
    &lt;arg name="script">propertySet.setString("foo", "bar")&lt;/arg>
  &lt;/function></pre>

    <p>
    We've now added a persistent property called 'foo', with the value of 'bar'. At any point
    in the workflow from now on, we will be able to retrieve the value assigned to 'foo'
    with the following peice of code.
    </p>


    <pre class="code">
  &lt;function type=>"beanshell">
    &lt;arg name="script">String value = propertySet.getString("foo")&lt;/arg>
  &lt;/function></pre>



     <h3>Transient variables</h3>
     <p>
     As well as the propertyset variable, the other important variable made available to
     workflow scripts, functions, and conditions is the 'transientVars' map. This map is simply
     a transient map that contains context specific information for the current workflow
     invocation. It includes the current workflow instance being manipulated, as well as the
     current workflow store and the workflow descriptor being used as well as other relevant
     values. You can see a list of all the available keys in the javadocs for FunctionProvider
     and Condition.
     </p>



    <h3>Inputs</h3>


    <p>
    Every invocation of a workflow action takes an optional input map. This map can contain any
    arbitrary data that you might want to make available to your functions or conditions. It is
    not persisted anywhere, and is simply a data-passing mechanism.
    </p>



    <h3>Validators</h3>


    <p>
    In order to allow for the workflow to validate inputs, we have the concept of Validators. A
    Validator is very similarly implemented as a function or condition (ie, it can be a class
    or script or EJB). For the purposes of this tutorial, we'll define a validator that checks
    that the input to 'finish first draft' includes a 'working.title' input that is not greater
    than 30 characters. Our validator will look something like this:
    </p>
    
    <pre class="code">package com.mycompany.validators;
    
public class TitleValidator implements</span> Validator {

  public void validate(Map&lt;String,Object> transientVars, 
                       Map&lt;String,String> args, 
                       PropertySet ps) throws InvalidInputException, 
                                              WorkflowException {
                                                               
    String title = (String)transientVars.get("workingTitle");
     
    if (title == null)
      throw new InvalidInputException("Missing workingTitle");
      
    if(title.length() > 30)
      throw new InvalidInputException("workingTitle too long");
      
  }
}
</pre>


    <p>
    Next, we register the validator in our workflow definition, by adding a validators element
    after our restrict-to element:</p>

    
    <pre class='code'>
  &lt;validators>
    &lt;validator type="class">
      &lt;arg name="class.name">
        com.mycompany.validators.TitleValidator
      &lt;/arg>
    &lt;/validator>
  &lt;/validators></pre>



    <p>
    So now, when we try to execute action 2, the validator above will be called to validate
    the input we had specified. So in our test case, if we now add:
    </p>

    
    <pre class="code">
    Map inputs = new HashMap();
   inputs.put("workingTitle", "the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog," +
                              " thus making this a very long title");
                              
    workflow.doAction(piid, 2, inputs);</pre>


    <p>
    We will get an InvalidInputException thrown, and the action will not be executed.
    Shortening the title will result in a successful execution of the action.
    </p>
    


    <p>
    Now that we have covered inputs and validators, let us move on to registers.
    </p>




    <h3>Registers</h3>


    <p>
    A register is a global variable in a workflow. Similar to a propertyset, it can be accessed
    anywhere in the workflow, for as long as it is active. The difference however is that a
    register is not a persistent value, it is a calculated value that is created or looked up
    anew with every workflow invocation.
    </p>



    <p>
    How is this useful? Well, in our document
    management system, it would be useful to have a 'document' register that allows functions,
    conditions, and scripts to access the document being edited.
    </p>



    <p>
    Registers are placed in the transientVars map, and so can be accessed from almost anywhere.
    </p>



    <p>
    Defining a register is very similar to defining a function or condition, with one important
    difference. Since a register is not invocation-specific (ie, it doesn't care about the
    current step, or what the inputs are; all it does is expose something), it does not have
    access to transientVars.
    </p>



    <p>
    Registers must implement the Register interface, and are specified at the top of the
    workflow definition, before initial actions.
    </p>



    <p>
    For our example, we'll specify one of the built-in registers, LogRegister. This register
    simply adds a 'log' variable that allows you to log messages using Jakarta's
    commons-logging. The advantage of using it is that it will also add the instance ID to
    every log message.
    </p>

    
    <pre class="code">&lt;registers>
  &lt;register type="class" variable-name="log">
    &lt;arg name="class.name">
      com.opensymphony.workflow.util.LogRegister
    &lt;/arg>
    &lt;arg name="addInstanceId">true>&lt;/arg>
    &lt;arg name="Category">workflow>&lt;/arg>
  &lt;/register>
&lt;/registers></pre>

    <p>Now we have a 'log' variable available, we can use it in an inline script by adding another pre-function:</p>


    
    <pre class="code">
  &lt;function type="beanshell">
    &lt;arg name="script">transientVars.get("log").info("executing action 2")>&lt;/arg>
  &lt;/function></pre>


    <p>
    The logging output will now contain the workflow process instance ID (piid).
    </p>

    <h3>Integrating with Abstract Entities</h3>

    <p>Because OSWf is not an out-of-the-box solution, some development work is required
    to make your project work correctly with OSWf. It is recommended that your core
    entity, such as "Document" or "Order", be given a new attribute: <em>PIID</em> for the process instance id. That
    way when a new Document or Order is created, it can be associated with a workflow instance
    also. Then your code can look up that workflow instance and retrieve workflow information
    and/or issue workflow actions via the OSWf API.</p>
-->


    <h3>Process Instance State</h3>

    <p>Sometimes it is helpful to specify a state to the process instance as a whole,
    independent to its progression or its steps. OSWf offers a number of such
    "meta-states" that a process instance can be in. These are <b>CREATED</b>,
    <b>ACTIVATED</b>, <b>SUSPENDED</b>, <b>KILLED</b>, and <b>COMPLETED</b>. When a process
    instance is first created, it is in the <b>CREATED</b> state. Then as soon as an action is
    performed on it, it moves automatically to the <b>ACTIVATED</b> state. If the caller does
    not explicitly alters the instance state, the process instance will remain in this state until it
    is unambigiously completed. This is defined to be the case when the process instance cannot
    possibly perform any further actions. In this case, the process instance will automatically move to
    the <b>COMPLETED</b> state.</p>

    <p>
    However, while the process instance is in the <b>ACTIVATED</b> state, a caller can termined or
    suspend the process instance (set the state to <b>KILLED</b> or <b>SUSPENDED</b>). A terminated
    process instance will not be able to progress any further, and will remain in the state it was in
    at the time of termination forever. A process instance that has been suspended will be 'frozen' and
    no actions can be performed on it, until it is explicitly returned back to the
    <b>ACTIVATED</b> state.
    </p>
	
    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    
    <p>
    This overview has hopefully illustrated the some of the major ideas in OSWf. You
    should feel comfortable enough now with the API and descriptor syntax to explore further on
    your own. There are many more advanced features that are not mention here, like splits,
    joins, nested conditions, auto steps, and others. Feel free to browse the manual to get a
    stronger grasp on what is available.
