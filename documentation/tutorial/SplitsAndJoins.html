        <h2>Parallel Workflows - Splits and Joins</h2>
        <p>
        In early office environment, 'work' was often contained in a paper folder, that folder
        was passed around the office going into 'IN' baskets. Each 'actor' operated on the work
        and passed it to the next actor's 'IN' basket.  This was a physical implemetation of a
        workflow process.  With computers we don't have those paper folders which to pass around
        but use a workflow process, this is called a 'Process Instance' and is
        worked on by actors assigned to each step.  These assignments are called 'an actors worklist or
        task list'.  With our computer workflow system we can also have work performed in
        parallel by multiple actors particpating in the workflow after it is split into steps.
        As these parallel steps are completed they are recombined by the 
        workflow.  This process is implemented using splits and joins. Which is the topic
        of this page.
        </p>

        <p>
        Take a quick scroll to bottom of this page and take a look a diagram of our next
        next workflow using a split and a join. <a id='intro' href='#workflowImage'>Go to workflow diagram</a> 
        </p>
        
        <p>
        This process is similar to the workflow for requesting a holiday but in this process we
        need the manager to determine if current workload can allow the employee to take some
        leave <b>AND</b> the the Human Resources department must also determine if that
        employee has sufficient leave time available or is restricted by some policy.  The
        result is a boolean AND decision where both the manager and HR must 'allow' in order to
        grant the request.
        </b>
        
        <p>
        You can download the entire workflow description using the link located just
        above the workflow diagram.  We'll only be looking at the split and joins in details.
        The Manager and HR step are similar to those described in the first workflow.
        </b>
    
        <h3>Employee Request</h3>
        <p>
        Not much new here, we've added an additional action for the Employee to cancel
        a request and terminate the process after started to fill out the form. Notice
        the attribute <code>finish='true'</code> so that the process instance gets set
        to completed.
        Instead of the 'Request day off' action going to a step it goes to a split.
        </p>

        <pre class='code'>
      &lt;action id='101' name='Request day off'>
        &lt;results>
          &lt;default-result split='1' status='Requested'/>
        &lt;/results>
      &lt;/action>
      
      &lt;action id="102" name="cancel" finish="true" >
        &lt;results>
          &lt;default-result exit-status="Cancelled"/>
        &lt;/results>
      &lt;/action></pre>


        <h3>Splitting the Workflow</h3>

        <p>
        Defining a split is pretty easy, you just specify the multiple steps which need to 
        be created.  Here step 200 is for the Managers decision and step 300 is the 
        HR Departments decision. Each of these actors now has a work item in their 'worklist'.
        </p>
            
        <pre class=code>
  &lt;!-- The leave approval goes to both the line manager and the HR Dept. ======= -->

  &lt;splits>
    &lt;split id='1'>
      &lt;default-result step='200'/>
      &lt;default-result step='300'/>
    &lt;/split>
  &lt;/splits> </pre>


    <h3>Joining - Making the Decision</h3>
    
    <p>
    Each time an action arrives at the join all of conditions are evaluated.  Here we are using
    the name/value pairs recorded in the PropertySet. The PackPub book and some of the original
    OSWorkflow examples used step <code>exit-status</code> in the conditions.  I personally
    find these fragile and prefer to use PropertySet values.
    </b>
    
    <p>
    By the way... I also like to delimit my scripts, no matter how small, with CDATA
    tags in case I need to add more code in the future.
    </p>
     
    <p>
    OK, so the join waits until both the Manager decides and Human Resources decides.  This is
    easily done within a join using an AND set of conditions. The join tests each result for
    non-null which means that it as been decided.  Only when both decisions have been made will
    the join allow the workflow to proceed.
    </p>
    
    <pre class='code'>
  &lt;!-- Joins ================================================================ -->

    &lt;joins>

    &lt;!-- The manager and HR decisions have been made in order to proceed -->
    &lt;join id="1">
      &lt;conditions type="AND">
      
        &lt;condition type="beanshell">
          &lt;arg name="script">&lt;![CDATA[
            propertySet.getString("Manager Result") != null;
          ]]>&lt;/arg>
        &lt;/condition>
        
        &lt;condition type="beanshell">
          &lt;arg name="script">&lt;![CDATA[
            propertySet.getString("HR Result") != null;
          ]]>&lt;/arg>
        &lt;/condition>
        
      &lt;/conditions>

    &lt;/join>

  &lt;/joins>
    </pre>

    
    <p>
    But wait!  We said it was a boolean AND decision such that if either denies the decision of
    the other will not matter.  So why make them go through the process of looking up records
    and balancing schedules.  Here is where OSWorkflow and OSWf really shine becuase the we get
    to write the code in order to implement the join decision and not rely on some vendor to
    implement joins their way.  And we get to use Java to write the decision logic.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Let's take a look. I've put the Java decision code in red and commented it. You do use
    comments in your code, don't you?  As soon as we get our first 'deny' the join will 
    proceed to the next step, any steps waiting to enter the join will be removed from the
    worklist of the respective actors.  For other workflow system this would be an advanced
    topic, here we use it in our first split/join.
    </p>
